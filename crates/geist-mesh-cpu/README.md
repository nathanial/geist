# geist-mesh-cpu — Parity Meshing (CPU)

This crate builds chunk meshes on the CPU using a Watertight Cubical Complex (WCC) approach. It computes the boundary of solids with parity toggles, emits one quad per boundary cell, and stitches chunk seams without cracks.

Highlights
- Watertight by construction: interior faces cancel via XOR parity; only boundaries remain.
- Per‑face emission (no merging): keeps one quad per boundary cell.
- Half‑open seam rule on X/Z: emit on −X/−Z planes; +X/+Z are owned by neighbors. Y is local to a chunk.
- Micro occupancy at S=2: slabs/stairs (and similar) are 2×2×2 “micro boxes” processed by the same WCC toggler.
- Thin dynamics (pane/fence/carpet) are emitted in a lightweight secondary box pass.

Key types
- `ChunkMeshCPU`: output mesh per material; buffers include positions, normals, uvs, indices, and vertex colors.
- `ParityMesher`: builds dense occupancy, derives face parity/materials via XOR, and emits greedy quads.

Algorithm sketch
1) Scale by S (default 2). For each solid volume (full cubes or micro boxes from occupancy), toggle six face planes in integer grid space:
   - +X/−X at x1/x0 across y0..y1, z0..z1, etc.
   - Toggling flips a parity bit; when parity becomes true, store a compact key (material id + light).
2) For each plane family (−X, ±Y, −Z), build a 2‑D mask of keys and emit one quad per boundary cell.
3) Seam ownership: do not emit on +X/+Z; for −X/−Z planes, seed/toggle using neighbor world blocks so faces match across chunk boundaries.

Lighting (current behavior)
- Per‑face light is sampled from the lighting grid; a small visual minimum prevents pitch‑black faces. For S=2 shapes, a face‑aware sampler approximates micro visibility.

Entry point
- `build_chunk_wcc_cpu_buf(buf, lighting, world, edits, cx, cz, reg) -> Option<(ChunkMeshCPU, Option<LightBorders>)>`
  - Builds a chunk mesh with WCC (S=2 for micro occupancy), then emits thin dynamic shapes.
  - Returns the mesh and optional light borders to feed neighbor lighting.

Seam policy
- Block types may opt out of occluding identical neighbors via `dont_occlude_same` (respected here).
- Additional seam fields (e.g., `dont_project_fixups`) exist in the registry but are not used by this crate.

Implementation notes
- Micro occupancy tables are generated on demand and cached (`occ8_to_boxes`, `empty4_to_rects`).
- Key constants live in `src/constants.rs` (e.g., `MICROGRID_STEPS = 2`, `OPAQUE_ALPHA`, bitset word math).

Tests
- See `crates/geist-mesh-cpu/tests/wcc.rs`:
  - Random solids parity/area checks
  - Seam stitching on -X/-Z (no duplicate faces on shared planes)
  - Per‑face emission triangle counts match expected surface area

Notes / Limitations
- Thin dynamics are emitted via a secondary pass (not through WCC grids) for simplicity.
- Micro occupancy uses S=2; higher S would require more memory and tuning.

Future work
- Integrate micro‑voxel lighting for S=2 shapes (see the scaffolding in `geist-lighting/src/micro.rs`).

## Profiling With Flamegraphs

These benches are sizable; use cargo-flamegraph to get actionable profiles.

Setup
- Install cargo-flamegraph (system-wide):
  - Linux: requires `perf` and appropriate kernel permissions.
  - macOS: uses DTrace; you may need to run with `sudo` and allow tracing.
- Ensure debug symbols for profiling builds: we provide a `flamegraph` profile with debug enabled.
- For better stacks, force frame pointers: `RUSTFLAGS=-C force-frame-pointers=yes`.

Run (helper script)
- `scripts/flamegraph_wcc.sh` runs the WCC benches under cargo-flamegraph:
  - All WCC benches: `./scripts/flamegraph_wcc.sh`
  - Filter a specific bench: `./scripts/flamegraph_wcc.sh normal_32x256x32`

Manual command
- `RUSTFLAGS="-C force-frame-pointers=yes" \`
  `cargo flamegraph -p geist-mesh-cpu --bench wcc --profile flamegraph -- normal_32x256x32`

Outputs
- SVGs are written under `target/flamegraph.svg` and Criterion reports:
  `target/criterion/<bench-name>/report/flamegraph.svg`.


## Algorithm Glossary (Plain English)

- Voxel: a single cube in the world grid with a block type/state.
- Chunk: a fixed-size 3D region of voxels processed as a unit.
- Axis‑Aligned: faces parallel to X, Y, or Z axes (no rotation).
- Face: one of six directions: +X, −X, +Y, −Y, +Z, −Z.
- Face‑Aligned Rectangle (Quad): a rectangle lying in a single face plane used for rendering.

- Watertight: a mesh with no cracks or holes along shared edges.
- Watertight Cubical Complex (WCC): computes the boundary of solids in a grid so only outside faces remain, guaranteeing watertightness.
- Boundary of Solids: faces that separate solid cells from empty cells.
- Parity Toggle / XOR Parity: flipping a bit when a solid spans a face location; even flips cancel, leaving only boundary faces.

- Plane Family (−X, ±Y, −Z): we emit in three groups of planes. We own −X and −Z; Y is chunk‑local.
- Half‑Open Seam Rule (X/Z): emit faces on −X/−Z borders; +X/+Z belong to neighbors; prevents duplicates.
- Seeding From Neighbors: read the neighbor’s world data and toggle our −X/−Z planes so seams match exactly.

- 2D Mask (of Keys): per‑plane grid of optional values; each value encodes material + light.
- Compact Key: a small code that pairs a material id with a light level for merge decisions.

- Micro Occupancy: sub‑voxel geometry represented on a finer grid inside a voxel.
- S (Micro Scale): number of subdivisions per axis (here S=2 → 2×2×2 inside a voxel).
- 2×2×2 Micro Boxes: half‑step AABBs that approximate micro shapes (e.g., slabs/stairs) at S=2.
- `occ8_to_boxes`: converts an 8‑bit micro occupancy mask to micro boxes.
- `empty4_to_rects`: converts a 4‑bit emptiness mask on a boundary plane to rectangles.

- Lighting Grid: stores light samples used to shade emitted faces.
- Face‑Aware Sampling (S=2): choose light consistent with which side of a micro face is visible.
- Visual Minimum: clamp to a small light floor to avoid pitch‑black faces.
- Light Borders: per‑edge light data exported so neighbors can match lighting across seams.

- Bitset Word Math: store bits in 64‑bit words; index with shifts/masks for fast toggles/tests.
- AABB (Axis‑Aligned Bounding Box): min/max corner box aligned to axes.
- Clipping to Chunk Interior: trim emitted rects/boxes to the chunk’s X/Z and Y bounds.

- Thin Dynamics: slender shapes (pane/fence/carpet) emitted as thin boxes in a secondary pass.
- Occlusion: a neighbor covers a face so it shouldn’t be emitted.
- `dont_occlude_same`: block‑type flag; identical touching blocks may not occlude each other.

## How It Fits Together (2D Example)

Below is a 2D XY slice to illustrate the flow; Z behaves similarly per plane.

Step 1: Start with solids (#) and empty (.) cells

    y↑
    3 | . # # .
    2 | . # # .
    1 | . . # .
    0 | . . . .
       +-------→ x

Step 2: Compute boundary via parity

- Consider the grid edges between cells. For every solid span crossing an edge, flip a bit.
- Shared edges between two solids flip twice (cancel). Edges between solid/empty flip once (remain).
- The remaining 1‑bits trace the closed boundary around the solids (watertight outline).

Step 3: Build a 2D mask of keys and emit per cell

- Rasterize boundary faces into a mask; each mask cell gets a key (material+light) or remains empty.
- Emit one quad per occupied mask cell.

Step 4: Emit quads and clip to chunk

- Each occupied cell becomes one quad with the correct face normal and world‑anchored UVs.
- Quads are clipped to the chunk interior on −X/−Z seams (and fully for Y bounds).

Seams (X/Z half‑open policy)

- On −X/−Z borders, we seed toggles using the neighbor’s world so the shared plane matches.
- We do not emit on +X/+Z; the neighbor will own those faces. This avoids duplicates and cracks.
