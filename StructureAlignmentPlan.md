# Structure Alignment Plan

Goal: bring dynamic structures (sun body, orbital schem platforms, moving builds) up to parity with streamed chunk lighting/meshing so visuals and lighting stay consistent everywhere.

## Open Questions
1. Should structures exchange light with the main world grid (i.e., update `LightingStore` and neighbor borders), or stay self-contained?
   Answer: yes
2. How frequently can we afford to recompute lighting for moving/orbiting structures—every pose change, on a timer, or only near the player?
   Answer: Let's try recomputing on every pose change. If that is too onerous, we can throttle the update rate.
3. Do we need to preserve a lightweight ambient-only rendering mode for tooling/debug, or can we fully migrate to the parity pipeline?
   Answer: No need to preserve anything, let's consolidate to just the parity pipeline.

## Phase 1 – Foundation & Decisions
- Audit the current structure pipeline to confirm ambient-only meshing, missing light atlases, and shader fallbacks.
- Catalogue all parity gaps versus chunk rendering (lighting propagation, biome tint, shader binding, column profiles).
- Answer the open questions above and lock requirements (e.g., whether to generate full `LightGrid`s per structure).

## Phase 2 – Mesher Parity
- Replace `build_voxel_body_cpu_buf` with a WCC-backed path (or shared helper) so structures reuse chunk face culling, micro-grid occupancy, and material lookup logic.
- Introduce pseudo-chunk coordinates for structures if needed to satisfy mesher assumptions.
- Ensure leaves/water/fog tagging matches chunk meshes so shader selection is consistent.

## Phase 3 – Lighting Computation
- Integrate `compute_light_with_borders_buf` (or equivalent) for structure buffers, seeding skylight/blocklight from world altitude and internal emitters.
- Decide refresh cadence per structure class (static platform vs. moving body) based on Phase 1 answers.
- Optionally sample nearby chunk borders when structures hug terrain to avoid seams.

## Phase 4 – Rendering Integration
- Have `StructureBuildCompleted` upload light atlases via `update_chunk_light_texture`, mirroring chunk logic, and store the textures on `structure_renders`.
- Bind fog/leaves/water shaders for structures using those textures; keep a fallback path while migrating.
- If structures share lighting with the world, emit any light-border updates or other synchronization events.

## Phase 5 – Performance, Tooling, Rollout
- Budget rebuild cadence, cache results (e.g., reuse light grids for repeated orbit angles), and add perf counters for structure jobs.
- Provide debug tooling (light volume overlays, toggles) and document workflows in `AGENTS.md` / CLI helpers.
- Land changes behind a feature flag, validate with `cargo test --workspace` and targeted perf runs, then remove the ambient-only path once parity is confirmed.
